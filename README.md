# Ledger — Personal FinTech / Expense Platform

A full-stack personal finance tracker: transactions, budgets, recurring
expenses, spending analytics, CSV bank-statement import, and threshold
alerts. Built with Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Prisma, and PostgreSQL
(deploy-ready for Vercel + Neon).

## Features

- **Transactions** — create, edit, delete, search, and filter by category/type/date
- **Budgets** — monthly limits per category with live progress bars and configurable alert thresholds
- **Recurring expenses** — subscriptions/bills on a daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly, or yearly schedule; a scheduler generates due transactions and catches up on missed runs, idempotently
- **CSV import** — upload a bank export, map its columns (including split debit/credit columns), preview before committing, and auto-categorize by keyword rules; re-importing the same statement skips rows already imported instead of duplicating them
- **Analytics** — month-over-month income/expense/net trend chart, category breakdown, top-category and rolling-average stats
- **Alerts** — automatic budget-threshold and unusual-spending detection, surfaced on the dashboard
- **Dashboard** — this month's net figure, income/expense totals, category breakdown chart, recent activity
- **Currency** — amounts are formatted in Indian Rupees (₹, `en-IN` locale/grouping)
- **Theme** — dark UI with a blue accent palette throughout (charts, buttons, badges, focus states)

## Getting started — from zero

These steps assume a brand-new machine with nothing installed yet.

### 1. Install Node.js (v18 or later)

- **Windows / Mac:** download the LTS installer from https://nodejs.org and run it.
- **Mac (Homebrew):** `brew install node`
- **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):** `curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash - && sudo apt-get install -y nodejs`

Check it worked:

```bash
node -v   # should print v18.x or higher
npm -v
```

### 2. Unzip the project and open a terminal in it

```bash
unzip expense-platform.zip
cd expense-platform
```

### 3. Install the project's dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This reads `package.json` and downloads everything the app needs (Next.js, Prisma, Tailwind, etc.) into a local `node_modules` folder. It can take a minute or two the first time.

### 4. Set up your environment file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

This project runs on PostgreSQL. Create a free database — [Neon](https://neon.tech),
Supabase, or Vercel Postgres all work — and paste its connection string into
`.env` as `DATABASE_URL`. For Neon specifically, use the **pooled** connection
string (the one with `-pooler` in the hostname) and make sure it ends with
`?sslmode=require`, so serverless functions on Vercel don't exhaust your
connection limit.

If you'd rather develop locally without setting up Postgres yet, see the
"Extending this project" section below for how to switch to SQLite instead.

### 5. Create the database

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

This creates `prisma/dev.db` and sets up all the tables (transactions, categories, budgets, etc.) from `prisma/schema.prisma`.

### 6. Add starter data (recommended)

```bash
npm run seed
```

Populates default categories plus a few sample transactions, a budget, and a recurring rent expense in ₹, so the dashboard isn't empty on first run.

### 7. Start the app

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser. You should see the dashboard in the dark blue theme with sample data loaded.

To stop the server, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal. To run it again later, you only need step 7 (`npm run dev`) — steps 1–6 are one-time setup.

## Design notes worth calling out in an interview

- **Idempotent recurring generation.** `lib/recurring.ts` only creates
  transactions for occurrences whose scheduled date has actually passed,
  then advances `nextRunDate` past them in the same operation. Running the
  generator twice — or catching up after the server was off for a week —
  never creates duplicates.
- **Idempotent CSV import.** Each imported row is fingerprinted from its
  date, description, and amount (`lib/csv.ts`). Re-uploading the same
  statement, even under a different filename, is detected and skipped
  rather than double-counted.
- **Rule-based categorization with a clear upgrade path.** Categories carry
  a keyword list; `categorizeTransaction` scores each category by keyword
  matches. It's simple and transparent for a v1, with an obvious seam to
  swap in an ML classifier later without touching the API surface.
- **Alerts are derived, not stored state.** `refreshAlerts()` recomputes
  budget-threshold and unusual-spending alerts from current data on read,
  rather than trying to keep a separate alert table in sync with every
  transaction mutation.

## Extending this project

- For local development without a Postgres server, switch to SQLite: change
  the `provider` in `prisma/schema.prisma` to `"sqlite"` and set
  `DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"` — just remember to switch back to
  `"postgresql"` before deploying, since Vercel's filesystem is read-only/
  ephemeral and can't persist a SQLite file.
- Add auth (NextAuth.js works well with the App Router) to make this
  multi-user — every model already has clean foreign keys to layer a
  `userId` onto.
- Wire `/api/recurring/generate` to a daily cron (Vercel Cron, or any
  scheduler that can hit an HTTP endpoint).
- Add bank sync via Plaid instead of/alongside manual CSV import.
